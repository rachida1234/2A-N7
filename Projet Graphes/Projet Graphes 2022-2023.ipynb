    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> As you know, a new epidemic has overwhelmed the world, COVID-19 jeopardizes people and changes our habits. It is easy to realise that knowing how illnesses spread is vital to our own protection. How can we predict whether a disease will cause an epidemic, how many people it will infect, which people it will infect, and whether or not it is dangerous to society as a whole ? Also, how can we determine which techniques to use in fighting an epidemic once it begins ? One way to answer all of these questions is through <strong>mathematical modeling</strong>. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> In this work you will have to review different epidemic modelings relying all on the representation by graphs of a human network called a <strong>contact network</strong>. A vertex in a contact network represents an individual and an edge between two vertices represents a contact between two individuals. The disease only spread from individual to individual if they are in contact, so through the edges. This representation is actually really common in research, and a lot of state-of-the-art modeling are built over it. From these different models you will be asked to draw conclusions from experiments on varying contact networks</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> For readability and ease of use, this project will be carried on a Jupyter Notebook, hence code and question answering have to be written in this unique file.

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">SIS is a compartmental model, ie a model where the population is divided into subgroups that represent the disease status of its members.

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> Combine with a contact network approach, this model can capture contact patterns (family, company, friends). Each vertex represents an individual in the host population, and contacts between two individuals are represented by an edge that connects the two. The probability of transmitting the disease from an infected to a susceptible individual along one of these edges or contacts is $\\beta$ (=<strong>infection rate</strong>). The probability to cure is $\\alpha$ (= <strong>curing rate</strong>). </p>\n",

As time moves forward, the disease will spread away from those initially infected, and two things may occur simultaneously at each time step $t$. First, each infected individual will spread disease to each of its contacts with a probability $\\beta$. Secondly, each infectious individual will recover at a rate, $\\alpha$ , at which point the individual will then no longer infect any of its contacts. After the disease has run its course, we can determine how the disease affected the network by calculating various quantities that help us better understand the outbreak.\n",

    "    <br>\n",
    "    As we can notice from the ploted figure, the degree of a node in a graph is an important factor in determining the spread of an epidemic on the graph. The degree of a node is the number of edges incident to it, and nodes with higher degrees tend to have more influence on the spread of the disease. This is because nodes with higher degrees have more connections to other nodes, and so the disease is more likely to spread from a node with a high degree to its neighbors. \n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "In addition to the inner properties of the disease (alpha, beta, and tau), the structure of the graph is also an important factor in determining the spread of the disease. The structure of the graph determines how the disease spreads from one node to another, and so it can have a significant impact on the overall spread of the disease.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    One analogy that can be made with real life from this experiment is the spread of covid through populations. In real life, the spread of a disease is influenced by both the inner properties of the disease such as its transmissibility and severity, but also the structure of the population such as the number of connections between individuals and the density of the population. And that's exactly what reinforced the widespread of covid in 2020 which pushed all countries to maintain lockdowns in order to restrict concats between infected people and the rest of the population .\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Unfortunately SIS model is valuable for diseases we can catch back since a cured person can get ill again. This is true for the flu, the cold, etc. However COVID-19 might create immunity for whom already got it and SIS can not take into account immune or dead persons. That is why we propose in this part to consider another model more adapted to COVID-19 called SIR. It stands for Susceptible $\\rightarrow$ Infected $\\rightarrow$ Recovered where the susceptible group contains those who remain susceptible to the infection, the infected group consists of those who not only have the disease but are also in the contagious period of the disease, and the recovered group contains those who were ill, got cured, are not contagious and can not get ill anymore.</p>\n",

    "    \n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> One limitation of SIR is that it does not model the reaction of humans when they feel the presence of the epidemic. Indeed, if feeling threaten or surrounded by infected, an individual may change its behaviors: wear mask, wash its hands, etc. This result in a smaller infection rate. That is why in this part we will also consider a variant of SIR called SAIR which stands for Susceptible $\\rightarrow$ Alert $\\rightarrow$ Infected $\\rightarrow$ Recovered. A susceptible individual becomes infected by the infection rate $\\beta_0$, an infected individual recovers and gets immune by the curing rate $\\alpha$, an individual can observe the states of its neighbors, then a susceptible individual might go to the alert state if surrounded by infected individuals with an alert rate $\\kappa$ on each contact with an infected, an alert inividual becomes infected by the infection rate $\\beta_1$ where $0<\\beta_1<\\beta_0$. In our simple SAIR model, an individual can not go back to a susceptible state when he got into the alert state.</p>\n",

This means that in an SIS model, an individual can be infected multiple times, while in an SIR model, an individual can only be infected once. This difference in the way recovery is modeled leads to different dynamics in the infected curve for SIR and SIS models.\n",

In contrast, in an SIS model, the number of infected individuals may oscillate over time, as individuals recover and then become susceptible to the disease again.

    "    There are several limitations of the SIS, SIR, and SAIR models that make them simplified representations of the spread of infectious disease, firstly these models do not take into account the spatial distribution of individuals or the movement of people between different locations. This can be a significant limitation, as the spread of infectious diseases can be influenced by the movement of people between different regions or countries and secondly These models assume that all individuals within a population are equally likely to be infected or to transmit the disease to others. In reality, some individuals may be more at risk of infection due to their age, underlying health conditions, or other factors.\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> The stochastic nature of infection propagation makes the estimation of the epidemic origin intrinsically hard: indeed, different initial conditions can lead to the same configuration at the observation time.

They both rely on spatial information by stating that the first infected is probably at the center of the cluster of infection. Mathematically:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The jordan center is expressed as $\\min_{v\\in \\mathcal{I}}\\max_{n\\in \\mathcal{I}}d(v,n)$ where $\\mathcal{I}$ is a connected component of the original contact network containing all infected and recovered vertices, and where $d(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the distance (= the shortest path) between 2 vertices (if not weighted graph each edge accounts for 1 unit). \n",
    "* The distance centrality is expressed as $\\min_{v\\in \\mathcal{I}}\\sum_{n\\in \\mathcal{I}}d(v,n)(\\delta_{n,I} + \\delta_{n,R}/\\alpha)$, where $\\delta_{n,I}=1$ if the vertex n is infected ($=0$ otherwise), and where $\\delta_{n,R}=1$ if the vertex n is recovered ($=0$ otherwise). You may note that in distance centrality we increase the weight of the recovered vertices by a factor $1/\\alpha$, it translates the fact that recovered vertices tend to be closer to the origin of the epidemic since they probably got ill before.\n",
